# Font Loading Logging Instructions

## How to Access Font Loading Logs

The comprehensive font loading logging system has been deployed with **Ver. 1.0.8**. Here's how to access the logged data:

### Step 1: Open Your Site
1. Go to: https://ronensg.github.io/VTeam/
2. Verify the version shows "Ver. 1.0.8"

### Step 2: Browse and Test Icons
1. Navigate through the app (especially the Players section)
2. Try to use icons (Add Player, Edit Player, etc.)
3. Let the app run for a few minutes to capture font loading attempts

### Step 3: Open Browser Console
1. Press **F12** (or right-click â†’ Inspect)
2. Go to the **Console** tab
3. Look for entries starting with `[FONT-LOG]`

### Step 4: Download the Log File
1. In the console, type this command:
   ```javascript
   window.downloadFontLog()
   ```
2. This will download a JSON file with all the font loading data

### Step 5: Share the Log
1. Upload the downloaded JSON file to our conversation
2. I'll analyze it to identify the exact font loading issues

## What Gets Logged

The system captures:
- All font requests (fetch, XHR, etc.)
- Font loading attempts and their URLs
- Success/failure responses with status codes
- Global font errors and unhandled promise rejections
- Expo font loader calls and arguments
- Google Fonts loading attempts and results
- FontFace API calls and results

## Alternative: Check Console Logs

If the download doesn't work, you can also:
1. Copy all the `[FONT-LOG]` entries from the console
2. Paste them in our conversation
3. I'll analyze the console output directly

## Expected Console Output

You should see entries like:
```
[FONT-LOG] SETUP_COMPLETE: Comprehensive font loading logging setup complete
[FONT-LOG] FETCH_REQUEST: Font request detected
[FONT-LOG] FETCH_REDIRECT: Redirecting font request to Google Fonts
[FONT-LOG] FETCH_SUCCESS: Fetch successful
```

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see `[FONT-LOG]` entries:
1. Make sure you're on Ver. 1.0.8
2. Refresh the page
3. Check if there are any JavaScript errors in the console
4. Try navigating to the Players section to trigger font loading
